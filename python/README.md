# Python

The python service processes and creates all of the open-discourse data

## Folders

- The `data` folder contains all of the cached data
- The `src/open_discourse` folder contains all of the python scripts. More information on these can be found in the [README in src](./src/open_discourse/README.md)

## Data Processing Pipeline

The Python component of Open Discourse implements a multi-stage data processing pipeline that:

1. Downloads raw XML data from the Bundestag
2. Preprocesses and cleans the data
3. Extracts structured information (speeches, politicians, factions, etc.)
4. Processes and transforms the data for analysis
5. Loads the final data into a database

### Important Data Conversion Note

During preprocessing, the `extract_mps_from_mp_base_data.py` script extracts data from XML files and converts it into pandas DataFrames, which are then serialized as PKL (pickle) files. This conversion from XML to DataFrame allows for more efficient processing and analysis of the politicians' data throughout the pipeline.

## Commands

- To setup the python environment, please run `make install-dev`
- To build the open-discourse data, please run `make full-run`

**Note**: If you are on Windows and have trouble installing `make`, I recommend you look into [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) and then run `choco install make` or you directly use [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which I strongly recommend anyways, as it gives you full Linux OS under Windows that integrates smoothly with Windows. If you do not want to install additional programs, you can also directly inspect the [Makefile](./Makefile) and look up the commands that are execute for a given `make` command and run everything manually.

## Setup

1. This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Please follow the install instructions according to your operating system. That's it, you are ready to use the Makefile!
2. Run `make install-dev` to install all required and dev dependencies into your virtual environment.
3. You are done! From now on you can always use `source .venv/bin/activate` to switch into the virtual environment or directly use `uv run ...` to run any command inside the environment (without the need to switch first into it).

**Note**: You should be inside the python folder, if you run `uv` or other commands, not in the root folder, so make sure to run `cd python` before doing anything else.

## Developing cycle

I will try to describe the general steps you should follow to start contributing.

1. Always make sure your `main` branch is up-to-date by running `git switch main && git pull`.
2. Create a new branch and give it a speaking name, ideally beginning with an issue number from our board: `git switch -c <branch-name>`.
3. Do your changes
4. If you need a new package, add id with `uv add <package>` or `uv add <package> --dev`, depending on whether it is a required package or a package used only during development.
5. Once you are done with your changes, add `pytest` unit tests for your functions and, if possible or applicable, add quality assurance tests to the `tests/qa` folder. Execute your tests with `uv run pytest tests`. **Warning**: Tests are not yet part of the pipeline!
6. If applicable, compare your refactoring changes to the previous version. You can switch to the branch `original-main`, which is the state of the project before we forked it and changed the logic, so it is up-to-date with the original repo. Run both pipelines up to your changed script and make sure that the output data files are identical.
7. You can and should open a PR as soon as possible to give others a chance to comment or get early feedback. Just push your branch with `git push` (when doing this for the first time, you also have to set up the upstream branch, just follow the command line instructions).
8. This will likeliy lead to a failing ci pipeline on GitHub and that is ok! Don't worry. To actually make the pipeline green, you should also run `make lint` and `make format`, which is identical to run `uv run ruff check --fix` and `uv run ruff format`. This will lint and format your project (make sure your code follows best practices and community style guides).
9. Another reason why the pipeline fails or the PR cannot be merged is that the main branch was updated in the meantime. You should make sure that you have the latest changes in your branch so run `git switch main && git pull && git switch <your-branch> && git merge main`. This will update the main branch and merge the latest changes in your branch.
